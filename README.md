# Speedway Game

An early prototype of an app for speedway fans. It showcases core interactions used during a heat: ranking riders by predicted points, voting based on expected results, and tracking a countdown for the ongoing race.  
Built using a MVC structure with a reusable timer and basic controller-layer unit tests.


## Features
- **Draggable rider ranking** – reorder riders to reflect predicted race results.  
- **Countdown timer per heat** – reusable `TimerView` with start/stop logic.  
- **Simple MVC architecture** – `GameController` manages state (players + timer).  
- **Unit-tested logic** – controller movement handling tested with XCTest.  
- **Clean UI elements** – circular rider images, background visuals, clear hierarchy.


## Technologies
**Swift**, **SwiftUI**, **XCTest**, **MVC**
